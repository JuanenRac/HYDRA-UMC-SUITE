# Ecosystem-wide versioning policy: the version bumps automatically on
# every REAL build (every run of build_exe.bat/build_exe.sh - the only
# thing that counts as a "build" for a Python app; just running
# `python main.py` does NOT bump anything), using an odometer/mileage-
# counter rule in base 10: the last component (patch) goes up by 1;
# if it would roll past 9, it resets to 0 and carries 1 into the
# component to its left (minor), which repeats the same rule leftward
# (major has no component further left, so it just keeps counting past
# 9 with no reset - same as a real odometer's leftmost digit never
# wrapping back to 0 mid-drive).
# Example: 0.1.9 -> 0.2.0. Another: 0.9.9 -> 1.0.0.
#
# Called by build_exe.bat/build_exe.sh BEFORE PyInstaller runs, so every
# packaged .exe/binary carries a version strictly newer than the last one
# actually shipped. Standalone-runnable too (invoked twice in a row is
# how this script's own bump logic gets verified without needing a full
# PyInstaller build each time).
